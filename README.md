📊 Project Overview – Sakila Database Analysis

This project explores the **Sakila DVD Rental Database**, a fictional but realistic dataset provided by MySQL. It represents a DVD rental store and includes data on films, customers, rentals, payments, and store locations.

Using **Python and Jupyter Notebook**, I analyzed the dataset to uncover patterns in customer rentals and film preferences.

✅ Key Insights:
- Identified the most rented film ratings in **Lethbridge**, showing that PG-13 and NC-17 movies were most popular.
- Found that over **3,100 rentals** in **Woodridge** were for films with a rental duration longer than 5 days.
- Analyzed store performance, revealing that over **8,400 rentals** were either from **store ID 2** or for films with a **low replacement cost**.

 🛠 Tools Used:
- Jupyter Notebook (Python)
- Pandas for data filtering and aggregation
- Matplotlib for data visualization

🔍 Purpose

The goal of this project was to:
- Practice data querying and filtering using Python (similar to SQL logic)
- Perform real-world data analysis on a relational dataset
- Visualize and summarize customer rental behavior for business insights
